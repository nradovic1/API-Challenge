# API-Challenge
With this excercise, I gor random longitude and latitude coordinates from which I  got a city closest to the coordinates. From this I could look at global weather and see how different location differ in weather. 
After that, I filtered the places to weather conditions that I prefer. Using gmaps, I found hotels closest to those filtered locations.

Three things that I can conclude from the first excercise are the following:
    1.  Temperature are the highest on average around the equator with 40 latitude north is close to it, showing how hot europe and north america now. At 20 degrees latitude north is the hottest which can be explained by the sahara desert and middle east. Northern hemisphere is hotter then the southern hemisphere is because it's summer here and winter there.
    2. Humidity, cloudiness, and wind speeds don't have any correlation. The wind speed is higher the more south in the souther hemisphere that you go.
    3. Southern hemisphere, even being in winter is comperable to northern hemisphere in the winter. It would be interesting in seeing this in winter to compare to their summer.
