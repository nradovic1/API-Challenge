# API-Challenge
In this excercise, I generated random longitude and latitude coordinates using numPy. Thanks to the CitiPy, a town/city closest to the coordinates was identified. With this information, I could look at current global weather from openweathermap ('http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?'') and analyzed how different location compare in weather. 
According to my weather preferences, I filtered to certain locations that fit that criteria. Afterwards, using google.maps API, located the nearest hotels to those coordinates that I chose. 

Three things that I can conclude from the first excercise are the following:
    1.  Temperature are the highest on average around the equator with 40 latitude north is close to it, showing how hot europe and north america now. At 20 degrees latitude north is the hottest which can be explained by the sahara desert and middle east. Northern hemisphere is hotter then the southern hemisphere is because it's summer here and winter there.
    2. Humidity, cloudiness, and wind speeds don't have any correlation. The wind speed is higher the more south in the souther hemisphere that you go.
    3. Southern hemisphere, even being in winter is comperable to northern hemisphere in the winter. It would be interesting in seeing this in winter to compare to their summer.
